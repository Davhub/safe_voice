## Safe Voice App - Audio Recording Status

### Current Status
- **Audio Recording**: Mock implementation (development mode)
- **Real Audio**: Temporarily disabled due to `record` package compatibility issues with Android Gradle Plugin

### Issue Resolved
- ✅ Fixed namespace error in Android build
- ✅ Removed problematic `record` package dependency
- ✅ Implemented functional mock audio recording
- ✅ App should now start successfully

### Mock Audio Features
- Creates realistic M4A files with proper headers
- Simulates recording duration and file size
- Works with all platform upload functionality
- Shows clear "development mode" messaging to users

### Next Steps for Production
1. Wait for `record` package to fix Android namespace issues
2. Or switch to alternative audio recording package
3. Re-enable real audio recording when package is stable

### Current Capabilities
- ✅ Voice report submission (with mock audio files)
- ✅ Text report submission
- ✅ Offline storage and sync
- ✅ Location services with geocoding
- ✅ Network status monitoring
- ✅ All UI features functional

### User Experience
- Users can record "voice reports" (creates mock files)
- Files are properly uploaded to Firebase Storage
- All other app functionality works normally
- Clear messaging about development mode
